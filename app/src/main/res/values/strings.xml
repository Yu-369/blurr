    "<b>ü§ñ Why Panda Needs Accessibility Services:</b>\n"
    "Panda is an AI assistant that helps you control your phone through voice commands. To do this, it requires accessibility permissions to understand and interact with your device.\n\n"
    "<b>üì± What This Permission Allows:</b>\n"
    "<b>‚Ä¢ Read Screen Content:</b> Panda can see and analyze what\'s currently displayed on your screen to understand the context and provide relevant assistance.\n\n"
    "<b>‚Ä¢ Perform Actions:</b> Execute touch gestures, taps, swipes, and navigation (Back, Home, Recent Apps) on your behalf based on your voice commands.\n\n"
    "<b>‚Ä¢ App Interaction:</b> Open apps, fill forms, scroll through content, and navigate between different screens as requested.\n\n"
    "<b>üîí Privacy &amp; Data Protection:</b>\n"
    "‚Ä¢ All processing happens on Gemini API\n"
    "‚Ä¢ No personal data is collected or but it is sent to Google Gemini\n"
    "‚Ä¢ Screen content is only accessed when you actively use Panda, otherwise Panda doesnt access screen content\n"
    "‚Ä¢ We implement safeguards to protect sensitive information, but Panda can still make mistake\n\n"
    "<b>‚ôø Accessibility Benefits:</b>\n"
    "This service enables hands-free device control, making smartphones more accessible for users with disabilities, visual impairments, or mobility limitations.\n\n"
    "<b>By proceeding, you understand and consent to Panda using accessibility services for AI-powered device automation.</b>"

With this, Panda can open applications for you directly and instantly (e.g., "Open YouTube"), instead of relying on slower methods of searching the screen.
